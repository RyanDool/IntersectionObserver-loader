# IntersectionObserver-loader
Helpful script to lazy-load images, using IntersectionObserver. If IntersectionObserver is not supported the images will load upon DOMContentLoaded.

## Getting Started
1. Install the script onto your site.
2. Add a class of "lazyloadimg" to all images and elements with background images you would like to lazy load.
3. Make edits to your HTML/CSS as needed.

   - For image elements replace src with "data-lzimg", the result should look something like this:  
     ```
     <img data-lzimg="/dir/someimage.jpg" alt=" " class="lazyloadimg">
     ```
  
   - For CSS background images add a data attribute of "lzbgimg" to the element and remove any CSS rules that apply a background image, the result should look something like this:
     ```
     <div class="lazyloadimg" data-lzbgimg="/dir/someimage.jpg"></div>
     ```
